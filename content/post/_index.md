&#9658; **Gifi's Statistics** is the discipline that proposes **statistical techniques**, provides descriptions and implementations of these techniques, and compares and analyzes their properties using real and artificial data. Gifi's Statistics is not **data analysis**, because a set of tools and manuals is not identical with the discipline that uses them. Unlike data analysis Gifi's Statistics is not concerned with inference, induction, probabilistic reasoning, or causal analysis.

&#9658; A **statistical technique** is a map of a **data space** into a **representation space**.

&#9658; The **data space** is the set of all possible outcomes of a given experiment or other data collection effort. For example: all possible

    1. results of a multiple choice (attitude/intelligence/personality) test on 100 subjects;
    2. outcomes of a clinical trial on a number of subjects;
    - outcomes of a survey on a number of voters;
    - essays in an essay test on a number of students;
    - event histories in a longitudinal study of a number of individuals;
    - heights and weights of a number of soldiers;
    - dissimilarity matrices of a number of colors.
All data spaces are finite.

&#9658; The **representation space** is the set of all possible outputs of the statistical techniques applied to the data space. For example: a number of

    - correlation matrices;
    - cross tables;
    - graphs and plots;
    - regression coefficients.

&#9658; Continuity and smoothness, defined by using suitable topologies, are the most interesting aspects of statistical techniques. They define the **stability** of the technique under various types of perturbations.
