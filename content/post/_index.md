1. **Statistics** is the discipline that constructs **statistical techniques**. and analyzes their performance. 

2. A statistical technique is a function that maps a **data domain** into a **representation codomain**. 

3. Statistics, unlike **data analysis**, does not have anything to do with inference, induction, probabilistic reasoning, causal analysis, and so on.

4. The data domain is the set of all possible outputs of a given experiment. For example

- all possible results of a multiple choice (attitude/intelligence/personality) test on a number of subjects;
- all possible outcomes of a clinical trial on a number of subjects;
- all possible outcomes of a survey on a number of voters;
- all possible essays in an essay test on a number of students;
- all possible event histories in a longitudinal study of a number of individuals;
- all possible heights and weights of a number of soldiers;
- all possible dissimilarity matrices of a number of colors.

5. All data domains are finite.


6. Representation codomain is the set of all possible outputs of the statistical techniques in a given experiment. For example
