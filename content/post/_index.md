&#9658; **Gifi Statistics** is the discipline that proposes **techniques**, provides descriptions and implementations of these techniques, and compares and analyzes their properties using real and artificial data. Gifi Statistics is not **data analysis**, because a set of tools and manuals is not identical with the discipline that uses them. Unlike data analysis Gifi Statistics is not concerned with inference, induction, probabilistic reasoning, or causal analysis.

&#9658; A **technique** is a map of **carrier space** into **target space**.

&#9658; **Data space** is a finite subset of carrier space. It is the set of all possible outcomes of a given experiment or other data collection effort. For example: all possible results of a multiple choice (attitude/intelligence/personality) test on a number of subjects, outcomes of a clinical trial on a number of subjects, outcomes of a survey on a number of voters, essays in an essay test on a number of students, event histories in a longitudinal study of a number of individuals, heights and weights of a number of soldiers, dissimilarity matrices of a number of colors.

&#9658; **Representation space** is a finite subset of target space. It is the set of all outputs of the statistical techniques applied to the data space. For example: a number of correlation matrices, cross tables, graphs and plots, regression coefficients.

&#9658; Continuity and smoothness, defined using suitable topologies on carrier and target space, are among the most interesting aspects of statistical techniques. They define the **stability** of the technique under various types of perturbations.
