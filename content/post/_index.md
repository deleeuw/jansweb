&#9658; **Jan's Statistics** is the discipline that proposes **statistical techniques**, provides **descriptions** and **implementations** of these techniques, and compares and analyzes their properties using real and artificial data. Jan's Statistics is not **data analysis**, because a set of tools and manuals is not identical with their use.
Unlike data analysis it is not concerned with inference, induction, probabilistic reasoning, or causal analysis.

&#9658; A **statistical technique** is a map of a **data space** into a **representation space**.

5. Jan's Statistics, unlike **data analysis**, is not concerned with inference, induction, probabilistic reasoning, or causal analysis.
6. The **data space** is the set of all possible outcomes of a given data collection effort. For example: all possible
    - results of a multiple choice (attitude/intelligence/personality) test on a number of subjects;
    - outcomes of a clinical trial on a number of subjects;
    - outcomes of a survey on a number of voters;
    - essays in an essay test on a number of students;
    - event histories in a longitudinal study of a number of individuals;
    - heights and weights of a number of soldiers;
    - dissimilarity matrices of a number of colors.
6. All data spaces are finite.
7. The **representation space** is the set of all possible outputs of the statistical techniques applied to the data space. For example: a number of
    - correlation matrices;
    - cross tables;
    - graphs and plots;
    - regression coefficients.
8. Continuity and smoothness, defined by using suitable topologies, are the most interesting aspects of statistical techniques. They define the **stability** of the technique under various types of perturbations.
