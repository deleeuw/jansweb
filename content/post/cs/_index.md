&#9658; **TDA** is the discipline that proposes techniques, provides descriptions and implementations of these techniques, and compares and analyzes their properties using real and artificial data. 

&#9658; A **technique** is a map of carrier space into target space.

&#9658; **Carrier space** is a superset of data space. **Data space** is the finite set of codings of all possible outcomes of a given experiment or other data collection effort. 

&#9658; **Target space** is a superset of representation space. **Representation space** is the finite set of all outputs of the technique applied to elements of the data space.

&#9658;  TDA is not **data theory**. Design, collection, coding, and cleaning of data prepare the input fot the technique: TDA's job has not started yet.

&#9658; TDA is not **data analysis** or **machine learning**. Inference, induction, probabilistic reasoning, and causal analysis use the output of the technique: TDA's job is already done.

&#9658; In TDA **models** are **gauges** for techniques. TDA investigates how a technique performs on data with known properties.
 
&#9658; Continuity and smoothness, defined using suitable topologies on carrier and target space, are among the more interesting aspects of statistical techniques. They define the **stability** of the technique under various types of perturbations. **Inferential statistics** studies the stability of techniques under the perturbations of random sampling .

&#9658; A **package** is a technique, with a description of carrier/data and target/representation spaces,  an algorithm, an implementation, a manual, examples, a stability analysis, and a license. A package is **incomplete** if it does not have all these components, and **opaque** if its components are not open source and/or open access.
