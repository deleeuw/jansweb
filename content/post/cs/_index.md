&#9658; **TDA** is the discipline that proposes **techniques**, provides descriptions and implementations of these techniques, and compares and analyzes their properties using real and artificial data. 

&#9658; A **technique** is a map of **carrier space** into **target space**.

&#9658;  TDA is not **data theory**. Design, collection, coding, and cleaning of data prepare the input fot the technique: our job has not started yet.

&#9658; TDA is not **data analysis**. Inference, induction, probabilistic reasoning, and causal analysis use the output of the technique: our job is already done.

&#9658; **Data space** is a finite subset of carrier space. It is the set of codings of all possible outcomes of a given experiment or other data collection effort. 

&#9658; **Representation space** is a finite subset of target space. It is the set of all outputs of the technique applied to the data space.
 
&#9658; Continuity and smoothness, defined using suitable topologies on carrier and target space, are among the most interesting aspects of statistical techniques. They define the **stability** of the technique under various types of perturbations. *Inferential Satistics* studies the stability
of techniques under perturbations by random sampling .

&#9658; A **package** is a technique, including a description of carrier/data and target/representation space,  an algorithm, an implementation, a manual, examples, a stability analysis, and a license. A package is **incomplete** if it does not all these components, and **inaccessible** if its components are not open source and open access.
