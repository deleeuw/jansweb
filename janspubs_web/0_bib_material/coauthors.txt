Dear co-author,

I have created a 612 entry BibTeX database of my published and unpublished papers, chapters, books, reviews, reports, and notes. See http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/janspubs/ for the index page. On the index page you will see your name in the list of authors. It would be great if you could click yourself and

a) check if the information (name, middle initial, publication details) is correct,
b) if there are any omissions you know of (any reasonable complete manuscript should be included, published or not)
c) if there are omissions, email me the details

The page also links to 487 pdfs of the papers. Some pdfs are missing, because I did not scan them yet, or because I could not find printed versions. If you have printed versions of papers missing a pdf link, or of papers we jointly authored that are not included, then sending me a scan would be awesome. I am not sure why I am doing this project, but given the fact that I am doing it I would like to make it as complete as possible.


Thanks -- and all the best -- Jan
