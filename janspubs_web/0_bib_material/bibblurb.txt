My "Collected Works" project now has a bibliography which is as complete as I can currently make it, with 612 entries. There are books, articles, chapters, reports, reviews, and notes. Notes are unpublished thingies that did not even appear in any formal internal reports series. I only included the ones that seemed to be somewhat complete and somewhat interesting. The bibliography has many duplicates, that first apppeared as internal reports and then subsequently got published (usually in another version). Some reports have appeared in different series from different centers. The html generated from the BibTeX bibliography links to 487 pdf copies of the 612 publications, thus almost 80% is available in pdf, but there are still alot of big scans I need to do (or commission). The distribution of the pdfs is

articles 112  
chapters  52  
reports  197  
reviews   27  
books      2  
notes     96
